This is a test repository where i practice git commands

## My first ever git command with online repository
I just clone github repository to my local machine using https protcol and clone command.
`git clone https://github.com/ShashankIITG/testRepo.git`

I was unable to use the ssh protocol.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ShashankIITG/testRepo.git
Cloning into 'testRepo'...
ssh: Could not resolve hostname github.com: Name or service not known
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```
